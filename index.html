                There were moments when I was learning a lot, making progress, and I was excited about building a new career in software.There was a lot to learn and the road felt really long. I sometimes doubted myself and I really questioned if I was on the right career path at all.Even after I started my first real job as a developer, on most days I still felt like I had no idea what I was doing. My co-workers seemed to be way ahead of me.
